Since you are in preparation of EMWCon, it is not a good time, but I still wanted to let you know: the city of Vienna decided that it is more suitable to bring SMWCon 2024 to Vienna, since then it is the 10th anniversary of the Vienna History Wiki (and the 10th anniversary of the SMWCon 2014 in Vienna).
So for SMWCon 2023 someone else has to offer a location.
Also, I talked to Lydia Pintscher of Wikimedia Deutschland, because I suggested her to bring the WikiDataCon 2023 to Vienna (it is held every 2 years and was in Berlin. I wanted to co-locate it with SMWCon). But she answered that this will not be possible since regarding to Wikimedia rules, it would have to be brougt to an "underrepresented community", whicht Austria is not.
